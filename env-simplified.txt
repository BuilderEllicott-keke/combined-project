# Intersellar - GE Custom - Simplified Environment Variables
# Copy these to your Netlify environment variables

# Admin Access Code (Special access for system administration)
ADMIN_CODE=Ellicott111010!

# Secret Salt for Code Generation (change this to something secure)
SECRET_SALT=your-secret-salt-here-change-this

# Optional: Override specific dates with custom codes
# Only add these if you want to override the generated codes
# Sep17_25=pdF9FR7b32:np9ffBUMvh
# Sep18_25=xXVYGdsfae:nQfDsFsXP5
# Sep19_25=CTxwLhr9FZ:B8gLPmxjvp

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy these 2 variables to your Netlify environment variables
# 2. Change SECRET_SALT to something secure and unique
# 3. The system will automatically generate daily codes based on the date
# 4. Optionally add specific date overrides if needed
# 5. Admin code (Ellicott111010!) provides special access to admin panel
# 6. Users can access with the current day's generated code

# How it works:
# - Each day, a unique code is generated based on the date + secret salt
# - The same date will always generate the same code (deterministic)
# - Codes are secure and unpredictable without knowing the secret salt
# - No need to manually manage 365 environment variables
